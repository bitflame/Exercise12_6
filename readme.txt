This is another versison of allient invasion game that does what is asked in exercise 12-6

Future ideas:
Modify the game so when the shipps hit, there is an explosion and then the game is reset. The display
logic can go right on top of _ship_hit() in alien_invasion file. 
Add the game sound and the sound to the explosion, sound of lazer when bullets are fired, a different 
explosion and sound when a bullet hits the alien ships
